President Donald Trump sparked controversy on Monday when, at an event meant to honor Native American veterans of World War II, he referred to Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas. This afternoon, in the Oval Office, Donald Trump was supposed to be honoring Navajo code talkers  American heroes who helped save the world from fascism and hate during World War II, Warren said in reaction, in an email to her supporters. Instead, Trump stood right next to those Native American war heroes and came after me with another racist slur. Pocahontas has been used before by Trump as a shorthand to attack Warren, whose Native American heritage he and others have questioned in the past.
