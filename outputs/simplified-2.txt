Gay men were entirely banned from donating blood until 2013. In particular, Caron pointed to the controversial Health Canada policy that states Canadian Blood Services and Hma-Qubec only accept blood from men who have not had sex with other men for at least a year. "We will bring an end to the discriminatory ban that prevents men who have had sex with men from donating blood," the Liberal platform stated. The previous policy allowed men to make donations only if they abstained from sex with other men for a full year. And on this, we have failed LGBTQ2 people, time and time again," Trudeau said in his remarks.
