The most frustrating thing about owning an Android phone is finally fixed. Google finally fixed the burger emoji. You might remember that Google CEO Sundar Pichai said hed drop everything and get the emoji fixed in October. Well, as of Android 8.1 developer preview 2 that dropped yesterday, the cheese is finally back on top of the patty where it should be. Were not sure how this one slipped through QA in the first place, but were happy to see it finally got fixed. Google also took the time to update the beer, beers, and cheese emoji as well. Both beer emoji now have beer all the way to the top of the stein with some froth on top.
