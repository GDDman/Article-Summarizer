North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into waters off Japan in the early hours of Wednesday morning in what was believed to be its longest-range test yet, escalating already high tensions with the US. Kim Jong-uns rogue regime launched the missile, its first for more than two months, in the middle of the night and it flew for around 620 miles, reaching an altitude of 2,800 miles, and splashing down 53 minutes later in the Sea of Japan. The missile ended up within Japans exclusive economic zone, which extends 200 nautical miles from its coast. In response to the test, Donald Trump, the US president, said: It is a situation that we will handle.
