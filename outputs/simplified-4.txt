Google finally fixed the burger emoji. In case you missed it, when a tweet about the problem with the emoji went viral  the cheese in Googles burger emoji is under the burger! I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top
How do you feel about the new emoji? The new Google burger emoji in the updated version of Android now matches all the others where the cheese sits on top. The new burger design in the Android 8.1 release puts the cheese in its correct place: on top of the burger patty.
