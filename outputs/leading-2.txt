The parliamentary leader of the federal New Democrats says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's apology to members of the LGBTQ2 community will ring "hollow" if his government keeps in place a policy that restricts gay men from donating blood. Trudeau delivered a lengthy, emotional speech in the House of Commons Tuesday where he addressed decades of discrimination LGBTQ2 Canadians faced from the federal government, including the so-called "purge" that saw thousands of people investigated, humiliated, and kicked out of the military and public service. Guy Caron's response on behalf of the NDP urged that the moment be a "springboard for action" for Parliament to tackle discriminatory policies that continue to penalize LGBTQ2 Canadians.
