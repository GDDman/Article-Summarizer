Google finally fixed the burger emoji. The new burger design in the Android 8.1 release puts the cheese in its correct place: on top of the burger patty. Both beer emoji now have beer all the way to the top of the stein with some froth on top. (Its a fun thread, if youve got the time.) According to Emojipedia, that has now happened. This looked a little unrealistic. Google CEO Sundar Pichai replied he would drop everything to address this issue. Android 8.1 will roll out in December, reaching Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P at that time.
